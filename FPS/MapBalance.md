# Exploring Map Balance in FPS Games

## Introduction of the Game

The game being considered is a 5v5 tac-shooter matchup to plant or defuse the Spike in a one-life-per-round, first to 13 series. It emphasises precise gunplay, tactical thinking and on-the-fly decision making.

The game is played on a map, varying between the existing ones. There are the attackers and the defenders. The attackers' objective is to plant the spike at one of the sites on the map or to eliminate all enemy players. The defenders have to prevent the attackers from planting the spike, have to defuse the spike if planted or have to eliminate all enemy players. The attackers and defenders after 12 rounds.

## Aim

Leaving aside tactics, strategies, abilities and gunplay, the objective is to analyse the maps for bias for attacking and defending sides.

### Safe Attack Position

While attacking, the player should focus on one enemy and not expose to the other. Being exposed to multiple enemies would lead to trade kills and baiting, leading to the elimination of the attacker. A good attack position will provide line of sight of one enemy and cover from all other enemies.

### Ambush and Sniper Positions

The attackers usually have 1,2 or more lanes to get into the sites, and may sometimes have mid lanes, to reach the site. The defenders tend to occupy ambush and sniper positions to eliminate the attackers. These are positions which have high exposure and visibility with areas of low exposure nearby. Thus the defenders can locate the enemy, establish line of sight to eliminate, and then hide easily. This combined with angle advantage is formidable for the attackers to deal with. Angle advantage is used when players use perspective to see the enemies before they see the player. This is because players further from a wall have less of the vision obscured by the wall.

### Off-Angles

Because of this, the attackers usually meticulously clear each angle and corner in an order. However, the defenders can occupy off-angles. Off-angles are not the standard ways to hold the site, rather, they are odd or uncommon places to catch players off-guard. This messes with the attacker's timing as they do not expect it.

### Pinch Points

Pinch points are points in the map that is the only exit of a particular area of the map. Defenders can ambush the attackers by waiting outside the exit.

## Conclusion

The above points have a lot of effect on the game. Map designers have to be careful of these stuff while designing a map. Having a map with a lot of safe attack positions would favour the attackers, while having a lot of sniper positions and pinch points tend to favour the defenders. Games tend to not keep pinch points. Some games keep limited abilities for covering line of sight like smokes and flashes to deal with ambush and sniper positions.
