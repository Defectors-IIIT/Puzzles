    "\n",
    "DFS traverses a graph by starting at a root node and following a path as deep as possible. Further paths are explored by backtracking. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS is performed starting from a node. If a node lies on the border, it is checked whether there is an\n",
    "exit from the maze. If yes, the path upto that node and the coordinates of the node are returned.\n",
    "Since DFS visits every node, the algorithm is guaranteed to find an exit, if one exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity : O(N<sup>2</sup>)\n",
    "1. Every node is visited exactly once\n",
    "A node is added to the stack only if it’s discovered status is false. Once added to the stack, the\n",
    "discovered status is set to true. Hence, every node is visited exactly once.\n",
    "2. Every edge is visited exactly twice\n",
    "The neighbor of a node is checked exactly once. Since the graph is undirected, this check happens\n",
    "at both vertices of an edge. Hence, every edge is visited only twice.   \n",
    "Therefore, it follows that for a graph with V vertices and E edges, the time complexity of DFS is O(V + E)   \n",
    "V = O(N<sup>2</sup>)  \n",
    "E = O(N<sup>2</sup>)   \n",

    "### Additional Space : O(N<sup>2</sup>)  \n",
